<center> <h1> Introduction to the Clack Graphical Router </h1> </center>

<a name="overview"/>
<h2> Clack Overview </h2>

<p>
Clack is an application that demonstrates network concepts 
by visualizing a network of virtual devices (routers and end-hosts) 
that run <i> real Internet protocols</i> like Ethernet, IP, and TCP.  
Clack provides you with a personal network to explore by allowing you to
generate traffic and ''zoom in'' to see what is happening inside 
each device as it handles that traffic.  
</p>

<p> 
Clack provides three "views" of network behavior:
</p>
<ol>
<li> <p><b>Network View: </b> Shows the entire network, depicting individual
routers/hosts, their IP addresses and their connectivity.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><b> Router View: </b> Shows the inside of a single router.  Router 
functionality is depicted as a collection of modular "components" connected
by "wires" that pass packets from one component to the next. 
</p>
</li>
<li> 
<p><b> Packet View: </b> A simple Ethereal-clone that supports packet inspection.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<a name="loading"/>
<h2> Loading Clack </h2> 

<p>
To launch the Clack Graphical Router, just open  
<a href="http://www.clackrouter.net/run/"> 
http://www.clackrouter.net/run/ </a> 
in a new window/tab in any Java 1.4 enabled browser.  
After starting Clack, you must specify a <i>topology file</i>, which describes the 
network topology and host configuration for your virtual network 
(note: for some assignments, Clack will automatically be configured with a topology
file and you can skip this step).  You can download this
<a href="ip_tutorial.topo"> topology file </a> 
to explore Clack during this brief intro.  
</p>
<p>
After loading Clack, select <i>File -> Open </i> <img src="open.gif" /> 
and choose the topology file.
To save your progress configuring the network hosts (as well as any 
graphical changes you may have made), select <i>File -> Save </i> 
<img src="save.gif" /> to create an updated topology file 
</p>

<a name="using"/>
<h2> Using Clack </h2>  
<p>Once a topology is loaded, Clack provides you with three levels of
abstraction for exploring your virtual network.  Open up Clack to see 
each type of view while you are reading the explanation. You can use the
<img src="zoomin.gif"> and <img src="zoomout.gif"> buttons to move between
the network and router views.   
</p>
<a name="networkview" />
<h3>Network View:</h3>
<p>
It is important to understand the topology of the network
before thinking about what is happening in a particular router or end-host.
The network view shows your network as a set of routers and hosts, connected
by network links.  Links flash green when they carry packets.  
Double-clicking on a link toggles the links enabled/disabled status, 
with disabled (i.e., disconnected) links colored red.
</p>
<p>
The network view also lets you view the routing
tables of all nodes at once to easily see how packet forwarding decisions are 
made.  
</p>

<tr>

<td>

<p> A condensed version of each host's routing tables can be viewed/hidden 
by toggling the <img src="fib.gif" /> button within the network view.  As
seen on the right, the routing table lists the destination network prefix, the
outgoing interface, as well as the last "octet" (ie: byte) of the next-hop
for that routing entry, if a next-hop exists.    
</p>
<p>
Whenever a routing entry is used to forward data, that entry is 
highlighted.

<h3> Router View: </h3>  
<table cellpadding=20>
<tr>
<td> 

<p>
Double-clicking on a router or host, you can zoom in to see 
the internals of the router.  This view breaks each piece of router 
functionality into distinct blocks called components.  Components have 
different "ports", which are connected by wires that carry packets 
between components.  Wires light up when packets are passed along them. 
</p>
<p>
Most components just receive packets from other 
components, and either drop them or pass them on (possibly after 
modifying the packet).  There are a few special blocks:  The gray interface
blocks at the top of the view represent the input interfaces of the router.
Packets enter the router at this point, and exit it at the gray output 
interfaces at the bottom.  The dark gray vertical boxes right above the 
output interfaces are packet buffers.

<b> Component Property Views: </b>
To find out more about the operation of each block and
its connections to other components, double-click on the component and explore
its ''properties view''.  Property Views contain HTML descriptions of each
component, as well as other statistics, and configuration information.  
If you are trying to reconfigure some router behavior, or view a visualization of
that feature, looking at the property view is your best bet.

<a name="packetview" />
<h3>Packet View:</h3> 

<p>
The router view let's you see what components interact, 
but not what is <i> inside </i> 
the packets.  For this, we provide a clone of the popular networking tool
ethereal.  At any point you can see all of the packets sent to and from 
particular host (on any interface) by clicking on the <img src="ethereal.gif">
 icon, 
and choosing a particular host to sniff on.  
Packets are recorded once when arriving at an
input interface, and once when leaving an interface.

<h2> Advanced Features </h2> </a>
<p>
We will now explore several of the more advanced features of Clack, including 
the Clack shell, controlling "virtual time" within Clack, and tracking down 
errors in Clack components. 
</p>
<a name="shell">
<h3> Clack Shell </h3>
<table cellpadding=10>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
This Clack network is not connected to the Internet, so you will have to 
generate traffic using the command-shell that let's you "log-in" to 
different hosts in your network.  To use the command-line, select
the <img src="konsole.png" /> icon, and choose the host you want to access.    
</p>
<p>
Type '?' to see all of the commands available in the shell.  To 
generate traffic, use the 'ping' command, followed by the IP address that
you want to contact. (Hint: to quickly change between different hosts using
the same shell, type ! immediately followed by the new hostname, for example,
'!router1').  
</p>

<p>
A faster way to reconfigure components is to use command-line utilities, which
mimic those provided by Unix.  For example, interfaces can be configured
using <i>ifconfig</i> and routes can be added to a routing table using
<i>route</i>.  Run these applications with the -h flag for exact usage 
guidelines.
</p>

</td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

<a name="time">
<h3> Clack Virtual Time </h3>
<table cellpadding=30>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
The toolbar on the right side of the Clack frame allows you to control the
speed with which all elements within the Clack network experience time.  For example,
slowing the speed will 
both slow the speed of packets moving from one component to another, as well as 
increase the real-world time it takes for periodic timers to expire within the 
Clack network.  
</p>
<p>
At the top of this side-bar is a clock that depicts elapsed
"clack time" in seconds since the network was created.  
The slider bar let's you incrementally change the speed of the Clack network.
The "pause" button <img src="pause.png"> completely stops the passage of time
in the network, while the "play" button <img src="play.png"> resumes time at the 
previous rate after time has been paused.  
</p>
<p>
Freezing time with pause can be helpful if you want to quickly analyze 
unexpected behavior.  However, beware that no packets will be transmitted
at all when traffic is paused.  
</p>
</td>
<td>
<image src="time.png" border=1>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<a name="errors">
<h3> Tracking Down Errors </h3>
<p>
If your network is partially, or incorrectly, configured and you attempt
to send packets across it, you are likely to cause some network error 
conditions.  What are examples of an error?  A routing table given a packet
with a destination IP that does not match any entry, an ARP lookup that 
receives no response, or a packet with a TTL of zero.  
</p>
<center><img border=1 src="error.png">
<br/>
<b> Figure: Error  with the RIPRoutingRef component.</b>
</center>
<p>
Clack makes it easier for you to find such errors when they occur in your
network.  If you are currently at the network view and an error occurs inside
a host, that host will become outlined in red.  When you zoom into that
host, one of the components will be outlined in red, indicating that it caused
the error.  Double-click the component to see its property-view, and access the
'log' tab to see the error message that caused the error.  Any packet that is
dropped will be indicated by an error. Select "Clear All Error Markings" in 
the View menu to clear indications of all past errors.  
 
</p>

<a name="debugconnectivity">
<h3> Debugging Connectivity </h3>
<p>Using the <img src="fib.gif"> button to view routing table entries
along with ping is a simple way to test whether you network is functioning
correctly.   You can double-click on links to disable them and see how
that affects connectivity.  
</p>
<p>
For larger networks, manually testing connectivity is a pain, so Clack
provides a mechanism to automatically test all pairs reachability using
ping traffic. Clicking on the <img border=1 src="questionmark.gif"> icon launches a
simple test that reports back any IP interface that cannot be reached by a
particular router.  
</p>

<a name="saving">
<h2> Saving and Loading Changes to Clack </h2>
<p>
You can save any changes you make to Clack, so you do not have to reconfigure
it each time you re-open it.  For example, if you move elements around in
the network or router views in order to make them better fit your 
screen, you just need to click the <img src="save.gif"> button, and you
can save this new set-up to a file.  In order to load these changes the
next time you run Clack, use the "-f" flag to specify a filename at the
command-line, or use the <img src="open.gif"> button.  

</p>
<p>
Selecting save serializes the <i> entire contents of the Clack network </i>
to file, meaning that changes you made to any host will show up in the new
configuration file.
</p>
<p>
Saving is also needed when you are building a special type of router for use
in an assignment.  Hitting "Save" will serialize all components within a router,
allowing you to build a router and have others view it later.  Using the normal
Save feature, some internal configuration of elements is not saved.  For 
example, the contents of a routing table.  However, using "Save All", the 
<img src="saveas.gif"> will serialize this state as well.  For most uses
of Clack "Save All" is not necessary. 
</p>
<a name="internetconnected">
<h2> Internet-connected Networks in Clack: </h2>
<p>
For some uses, it is helpful to have Clack networks connected to the
Internet so you can generate traffic on any computer and have it flow
through your Clack network. You will know that your are working with a 
Internet-connected version of Clack if your network view contains an Internet
"cloud" and "firewall" component.
<p>
<center> <img src="inetfirewall.png" border=1> </center>
</p>
<p> 
Clack integrates with the 
<a href="http://yuba.stanford.edu/vns/"> Virtual Network System </a> (VNS)
to support this, but the use of VNS should be largely transparent to the user. 
If you are using Clack with Internet connected networks, you will be provided
with a unique number called a "topology ID" that Clack will prompt you for at 
startup.  
</p>
<p>
Be aware that slowing down Clack's virtual time too much may cause real Internet
hosts that are routing traffic through Clack to time-out.
