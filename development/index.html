<h2>  Development Central for the Clack Graphical Router Project </h2>
</center>

Clack is an <b> open-source </b> 
graphical router that is written in Java.  Clack routers exist in 
virtual networks that are connected to the Internet, meaning your router
processes and analyzes REAL Internet traffic.  
A lot of functionality already exists for Clack,
but we are always looking for more people to help with development.  Coding
in Clack can be a surprisingly easy and fun experience.  You can:

<ol>
<li> <p> Write modular components to add new networking functionality to Clack. </li>
<li> <p> Use Java GUI programming to create visualizations of router 
behavior or traffic passing through the router </li>
<li> <p> Create command-line programs that run on top of a Clack router to 
inspect/modify router state (e.g arp -a, ifconfig) or generate traffic to 
run through your virtual network (e.g. ping, wget) </li> 
</ol>

<p> The best way to learn about how to code with clack is to read the <a href="../hackclack2.pdf"> Clack Router Developer Docs </a> and to work with the 
source code and javadocs found in the <b> Downloads </b> section of the main
page.  If you still have concerns after contacting these sources, feel free
to email us.  </p>

<h2> Development Ideas </h2>

We've been working with Clack for some time now, and have a running list of
ideas on what might be fun / useful to develop.  If you do start working on
one of these projects, let us know so we can make sure no work is duplicated!
We can help you by providing specific topologies to test on.   

<h3> Possible new components to create </h3>  
<ul>
<li>  <p><b>ICMP Destination unreachable generation:</b>  
While our ARP component errors
when no response if received, currently a dest unreach is not generated.  
</p>
</li>
<li>  <p> <font color="red"><i> (DONE) <strike>High Priority</strike> </i></font> 
<b> Link-state routing component (ie: OSPF):</b>  We recently finished a RIP implementation that has been used as a course assignment, so all of the routing
interfaces are documented <a href="../rip/api.html"> here </a>.  Extending 
Clack to also support a link-state protocol will be very useful.
<p/>
</li>
<li> 
<p><font color="red"><i> (DONE) </i></font> 
<b>NAT component:</b> demonstrate different types of NAT, symmetric, half-cone,
etc and provide a basic visulization of a the internal translation tables.
</p>
<li>  <p> <b> Firewall / Intrusion detection component: </b>  This could make for a 
very fun class assigment, since Clack networks are virtual, meaning that 
students can use real tools to pen-test each other's IDS/firewall.  Providing
a Clack application to configure your system is probably a good idea.  
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>
<b> Weighted-Fair-Queueing (WFQ): </b> Clack already demonstrates basic queueing 
principles, and we are currently creating a new visualization for RED queues.
WFQ would be another useful queueing discipline to demonstrate visually. 
</p>
<li> <p> <b> Etherenet switch/bridge: </b> Demonstrate Ethernet switching,
 possibly including port learning and rapid spanning tree protocol (RTSP). 
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Possible new Clack applications to create </h3>
<ul>
<li> <p> <b> Generic TCP and UDP flow generation:</b> Create a generic
command-line mechanism for generate TCP or UDP traffic at a particular rate.
The <a href="http://dast.nlanr.net/Projects/Iperf/"> iperf </a> tool would be
a good example to clone.  </p> </li>
<li> <p> <b> traceroute: </b> Simple implementation of traceroute.  </p> </li>
<li> <p> <b> ARP utility: </b> A command-line utility to view and  modify arp 
entries on a router.  Based on the 'arp' unix utility.  </p></li>
<li> <p> <b> Cisco commands: </b>  Currently clack supports unix-like commands for
viewing and modify configuration information include routing tables.  
Clack could also support the Cisco commands. 
</p> </li>
</ul> 

<h3>  Other Coding Needed for Clack </h3>
<ul>
<li> <p> <font color=red> <i> (DONE) <strike> High Priority </strike></i> </font>
<b> Disconnected Virtual Networks: </b>  
Allowing use of Clack without VNS for simple demos that do not require 
Internet connectivity to be effective.  This will involve getting the 
actually topology from a local file, not from VNS, and rewriting all 
VNS and firewall assumptions that are embedded in the startup configuration
code.  </p> </li>
<li> <p> <font color="red"><i> High Priority </i></font> 
<b> GUI for creating topologies: </b>
Right now, users cannot change the number of routers in a virtual network,
or their connectivity, without the help of Clack admins.  We would like 
users to graphically be able to build their own networks.  A good amount of the
code for this is already written, but it has not been integrated and tested.
</p></li>
<li> <p> <font color="red"><i> High Priority </i></font> 
<b> Directional links in network view: </b> Currently, interfaces within the
network view are connected by a single link, which lights up whenever a packet
is sent in either direction.  We want to modify this so users can tell the 
direction of transmitted traffic. 
</p> 
</li>
<li>  
<p> <b> Ethereal Filters: </b> Add filtering capabilities to Ethereal, 
so that users can control what packets
are visible in the top ''packet list'' window.  Ideally, this would use 
intelligent drop down boxes so that students would not need to remember any
kind of filter syntax.  For example, we would have a ''src IP'' filter drop
down that would list all source IP's currently in the table, and allow
the user to select one or more to allow.  
</p> </li>
<li> 
<p> <b> TCP endhost visualizations:</b>.  We have a simple Internet compatable 
TCP implementation, and had a nice ``hierarchical component'' that let the
user explore within the TCP stack.  It was 80% done and we 
haven't had time to finish it yet.  We were also planning on adding some 
stuff similar to the "Timeline" and "TCP State" views in 
<a href="http://www.cs.mtu.edu/vta/">  VTA </a>.  Existing code is mainly 
in packages <i> net.clackrouter.component.tcp</i> and <i>net.clackrouter.gui.tcp</i>.
Contact us if you are interested.  </p> </li> 
<li> <p> <b> More/better Ethereal parsers:</b> There are more network level
and application level protocols that
Clack's ethereal packet analyzer could parse and show.  
The TCP and UDP parsers could also stand to be cleaned up.
</p></li>
<li> <p> <b>Clean up IPPacket class: </b> 
Better interface for accessing IPPacket fields.  As of now, they still
use the old ByteBuffer getters/setters inherited from long ago.
</p></li>
</ul>
<h3> Non-Coding Development Needed </h3> 
<ul>
<li> <p> <font color=red> <i> High Priority</i> </font> 
<b> Clack Demos: </b> 
A series of demos (both video and live) that show major capabilities of
Clack.  Definitely need: 1) RIP routing 2) ethereal 3) TCP vs. UDP
4) REDQueue </p></li> 
</ul>
