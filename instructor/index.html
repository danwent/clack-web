<center><h2> Clack Graphical Router: Instructor Resources </h2></center>

<center>
<table width="90%">
<tr>
<td>
<p> This page aims to give course instructors and staff an idea of the different
ways Clack has already been succesfully used in undergraduate networking
courses at several universities.  We will help modify assignments to fit your needs. 
</p>
<p> If you are an instructor and are interested in using Clack for any
of the uses described below, or have an idea for a new use of Clack,
please contact us at info (at) clackrouter.net 
</p>
<h2> Existing Assignments, Demo's, and Labs </h2> 

<h3>  IP, ARP, and Ethernet Basics </h3> 

Students use Clack and its ethereal packet sniffer to answer questions 
about the about simple encapsulation and forwarding.  See 
<a href="section1.html"> IP Basics </a>.  

<h3>  IP Addressing and Routing </h3> 

Students are given a Clack network of a few routers and 
several "subnets", without any IP addresses assigned.  Given a
/24 of network address space, the students must assign each subnet
sufficient address space for its size requirements, and then set-up
forwarding entries within the routers to make all subnets reachable.
Configuration can be done either graphically
or via a Clack command-line that emulates Unix functionality.
See <a href="section2.html"> IP Addressing and Routing </a>.  

<h3> Comparing Distance Vector (RIP) and Link-state (OSPF) Routing </h3>

Students are provided with identical virtual networks, one with each router
using OSPF, and another with each router running RIP.  Students must view
routing tables and use a packet sniffer to determine how RIP and OSPF 
operate differently given various network dynamics (e.g., link failure).
See <a href="section3.html"> RIP vs. OSPF </a>.  

<h3> RIP Routing Programming Assignment </h3>

<p> Simon Fraser University used Clack as a programming platform to have 
student implement a simple version of the RIP routing protocol, including
split horizon and poison reverse.  Clack let students see the real-time 
routing tables their implementation was using, probe their topology to test
forwarding, and modify link status + cost to see the protocol react.  
The write-up for the RIP assignment is available <a href="rip.html"> here </a> . </p>

<p> For obvious reasons, the RIP source-code is not distributed with the 
standard Clack source.  If you are an instructor and wish to see the 
reference implementation of RIP in Clack, email us at info@clackrouter.net </p>

<p>A topology of RIP routers can be found here:  
<a href="../livedemo/rip_demo.html"> RIP Topology </a> 
</p>

<h3> TCP and UDP Congestion Control </h3> 

An introduction to Computer Science for non-majors class at Princeton
University used Clack to teach students high-level concepts about congestion
control on the Internet, focusing on the differences between TCP and UDP.
A draft of the lab, which had students analyze TCP downloads and real-time 
streaming music, is available <a href="princeton_lab.pdf"> here </a> 
(PDF format).  

<h3> OSPF Routing Programming Assignment </h3>

<p> Clack now has a link-state routing implementation that can be used as
a basis for networking labs and programming assignments.  As described above
in the RIP lab, Clack provides a powerful platform to demonstrate the 
concepts that students must implement, and then to debug their code
as they implement a very simple version of OSPF while 
leveraging Clack visualization capabilities for free. </p> 
<p>A topology of OSPF routers can be found here:  
<a href="../livedemo/ospf_demo.html"> OSPF Topology </a> 
</p>

<h3> Looking Inside a Real IP Router </h3>

Several universities have used Clack to demonstrate the basic composition of
an IP router, and to have students visualize how traffic is forwarded 
through a router and how the router responds to probes such an Ping and 
Traceroute requests.  Primarily, Clack is used in conjunction with an
<a href="http://yuba.stanford.edu/vns/assignments/cs244a_router.html"> 
assignment </a> in which student program a simple IP router in C using the
<a href="http://yuba.stanford.edu/vns/">Virtual Network System </a>.  


<h3> Network Address Translation (NAT) Visualization </h3>

A simple lab to help students understand how NAT works, to visualize what
state a router must keep, and test what traffic can and cannot pass through
a NAT.  Implementation complete, demo link and write-up coming soon...

<h3> RED Queue Visualization </h3> 

<p> Visualize how modifying Random Early Drop (RED) paramters impacts
the drop decision.  Implementation is complete, demo link and write-up
coming soon... </p>
