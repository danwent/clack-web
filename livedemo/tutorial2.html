<p> We will now go inside the Router to see exactly what is happening. </p>
<p> Double-click on the blue router and you will see a view of the inside of your router where each block implements a portion of router functionality and packets are passed between blocks. </p>
<p> Ping the same IP address as before, this time watching what router blocks are needed to handle the ping. </p>
