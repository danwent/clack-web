<p> Because a FromDevice element (as well as a ToDevice element)
is specific to the virtual host reserved, such elements can neither
be created or deleted.
</p>

<p>A FromDevice intercepts all packets received by the named
network interface and pushes them out the only
port. The outgoing packets include the link-level header. 
The device does not operate in promiscuous mode and forwards only
Ethernet packets sent to its hardware address, or the ethernet
broadcast.
</p>

<p>
The device operates at the same link speed as all other interfaces,
but a Delay element combined with a Queue can be used to simulate a bottleneck link.
