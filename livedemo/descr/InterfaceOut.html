<p> Because a ToDevice element (as well as a FromDevice element)
is specific to the virtual host reserved, such elements can neither
be created or deleted.
</p>

<p>Pulls packets from its single input and sends them out the named network interface.
Packets must already have an Ethernet header.

but a Delay element combined with a Queue can be used to simulate a bottleneck link.
