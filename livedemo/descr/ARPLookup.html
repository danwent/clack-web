<h2><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p> An ARPLookup element contains the ARP cache, which is a per-interface collection of IP address to
Hardware address mappings for hosts on the same link as that interface.
</p>
<p> This element has two input ports.  One is for outgoing IP packets that need to be encapsulated in
Ethernet headers with the hardware address associated with the IP next hop address.  This address is found
by performing a lookup in the element's ARP cache.  If no entry is found, the outgoing packet is queued within
the element while the ARPLookup generates an ARP Request and awaits the reply. 
</p>
<p> The second input port is for incoming ARP Reply packets, stripped of their Ethernet header.  
When a Reply is receieved, the mapping is added
to the ARP cache and any IP packets waiting for the resolution of that address are immeadiately sent.  
</p>
<p>  The element has a single output port which pushes out both Ethernet encapsulated IP packets and Ethernet
encapsulated ARP Request packets.
