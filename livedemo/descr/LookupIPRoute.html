<h2><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>

<p>
Contains the routing table, which consists of entries made up of a destination and mask , an optional next-hop gateway address, and an
output inteface.  For example, a route to the prefix 171.67.71.0/24 would have destination = 171.67.71.0 and mask = 255.255.255.0 .
</p>
<p> Takes IP Packets on its only input and looks up the destination 
address of that packet in its routing table, using longest-prefix-match.
Sets the outgoing interface annotation for the packet and emits it on the port for packets with valid routes.
</p>

<p>  If the packet is addressed to one of the local IP addresses, it is pushed out a separate port.
</p>
<p>  Finally, if no route if found and the packet is not addressed to a local interface, it is pushed out
a third output port
</p>

Each argument is a route, specifying a destination and mask, an optional gateway IP address, and an output port.
