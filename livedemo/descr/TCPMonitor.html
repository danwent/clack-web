<h1 class='NAME'><a name="NAME">TCPMonitor</a></h1>

<p>Clack element;
Monitors TCP flows encapsulated within IP packets.
</p>

<h2><a name="PROCESSING+TYPE">PROCESSING TYPE</a></h2>
<p>Push</p>

<h2><a name="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>

<p> Has one input and one output port, both of which are push ports.  This element expects 
IP packets on its input and passes these packets to its output unchanged.
</p>
<p>
For each IP packet, the TCPMonitor checks if encapsulates a TCP Packet and if so stores a record for
a flow defined by the 5-tuple: (tcp, host A IP address, host A port, host B IP address, host B port).
The assigned values of host A and B are completely arbitrary.
</p>
<p>
TCPMonitor reports key statistics about all of the flows seen recently (flows timeout after a specified period).
Information includes the control values seen within the last packet sent by A and B, and the outstanding (ie: unacknowledged)
data each host has sent in the network.
